#### My second personal project, a full-stack website for looking up movie-related information and media as well as creating custom user watchlists.

## Current functionality

- Search for a movie by name and see relevant information (plot summary, cast, budget, etc.)
- Chat with AI based on ChatGPT 3.5 to ask movie-related questions like:
  > "Make me a list of thrillers to watch"
  > "What is the most expensive drama ever made?"
  > "Recommend me something similar to Alien"
- Create an account where you can customize your name and profile picture
- Create custom watchlists with customizable names and drag and drop functionality for re-arranging the list according to your needs
